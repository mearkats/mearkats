### Hi there 👋

I'm David Mear - I blog about all things IT. When I come across an issue, I fix it and then blog about it! The past year has seen me learning PowerShell and creating solutions for common problems.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on ... My blog posts on [mearkats.co.uk](https://www.mearkats.co.uk)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Advanced PowerShell to improve my abilities
- 📫 How to reach me: ... You can reach me at david@mearkats.co.uk
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... When I was 6 years old, I literally blew up my first computer. That was when I knew I wanted to go into IT.
- 😁 Projects I'm proud of: ...
  * My [Microsoft Store App Install PowerShell script](https://github.com/mearkats/MS-Store-App-Install-Powershell-RMM-Friendly) which allows you to install Microsoft Store Apps from an RMM! How cool is that!!
